This is the project of the paper "A Non-Invasive Interpretable NAFLD Diagnostic Method Combining TCM Tongue Diagnosis".

**Abstract**

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathological syndrome characterized by hepatic steatosis resulting from the exclusion of alcohol and other identifiable liver-damaging factors. It has emerged as a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Currently, the conventional methods for NAFLD detection are expensive and not suitable for users to perform daily diagnostics. To address this issue, this study proposes a non-invasive and interpretable NAFLD diagnostic method. This method involves extracting patients' non-invasive physiological indicators (e.g., Height, Weight, BMI, etc.) and tongue features, which are subsequently integrated using a fusion network referred to as SelectorNet. \textbf{SelectorNet can autonomously learn to process different features, providing attention scores for different attributes from the network for each case.} The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 77.22\% using only non-invasive data, and it also provides compelling interpretability matrices. This study contributes to the early diagnosis of NAFLD and the intelligent advancement of TCM tongue diagnosis.
